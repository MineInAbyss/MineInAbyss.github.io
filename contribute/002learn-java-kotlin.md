# Learning Kotlin

We use Kotlin to make our plugins. Kotlin is built on the same thing as Java so we often interact with Java as well. This guide will help you start learning Kotlin or programming in general.

## No programming knowledge

JetBrains (the creators of Kotlin) have made their [Kotlin Basics](https://hyperskill.org/tracks/18) track free on their learning platform Hyperskill.

They split everything into small modules starting from 0 and building up to a project of your choice. Have a look around and start whatever looks interesting. You can even switch midway through!

Note that we use IntelliJ as our IDE. Hyperskill will suggest you use it too, so do, it's great!

## Existing programming experience

Hyperskill can be pretty slow if you are already experienced, but consider looking over it. Otherwise, [read the documentation](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/getting-started.html#learn-kotlin-fundamentals). It is extensive and has many other recommendations for learning.

I recommend learning the syntax basics and jumping right into some easier issues, then just looking up everything you don't understand.

I've also used https://typealias.com/start/ a bit.

## Notes on IDE
- Use [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=windows).
- [Set up your JDK](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/sdk.html#set-up-jdk) to use the latest OpenJDK version.
