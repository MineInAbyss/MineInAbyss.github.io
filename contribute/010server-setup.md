# Server setup

You will need a working Spigot/Paper server if you wish to test plugins. Some plugins currently require Paper, which provides considerably better performance than Spigot. Get the [Paper jar](https://papermc.io/downloads), then install Paper with [this guide](https://paper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/server/getting-started.html).
