# Finding issues

We keep track of things to do in issues on GitHub. They are grouped together into projects. Most projects sort issues by priority and each issue has a label for difficulty. 

## Key projects
 - [Miscellaneous](https://github.com/orgs/MineInAbyss/projects/6): general issues or bugs that you can jump right into.
 - [Active Projects](https://github.com/orgs/MineInAbyss/projects/22): bigger projects we are working on. Some may be futher split into subprojects. You will need to learn more to start helping, but can focus on one thing.
 - [ECS](https://github.com/orgs/MineInAbyss/projects/4): design of our entity component system. If you want a big project to work on that isn't making plugins, this is it.
 - [All projects](https://github.com/orgs/MineInAbyss/projects)

## Contribute

Once you've found an issue to work on, here's the general process to help out with that project:

- Comment on the issue saying you wish to take it up. We will assign you to it shortly.
- Fork the project in question and set it up locally.
- Try to make a new branch for each feature you add.
- Open a Pull Request and wait for us to review!
