# Coding Conventions

## Idofront: our shared utils library

Idofront is a library we share between most of our plugins that adds helper functions, a command DSL, and more. Be sure to check out its [wiki](https://github.com/MineInAbyss/Idofront/wiki)!

## Code style guide

We follow the style guide set out by IntelliJ's autoformatter. This has recently been updated to the [Android Kotlin Style Guide](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/style-guide) so make sure you switch to it if you get the prompt.

</details>

By default you may run the formatter with `Ctrl+Alt+L`. If the formatter makes no changes, we generally wont ask you to make any more specific style changes.

We have looked at setting up ktlint before but there are currently no plans to strictly enforce code style.
