# GitHub

For code, we mainly collaborate through GitHub and manage our issues using [GitHub projects](https://github.com/orgs/MineInAbyss/projects). We use Notion for more private teams like art, build, and design.

If you are new to git or GitHub, check out [this official guide](https://guides.github.com/).

## Branching

We try to `feature branch` as often as possible. This means, when you add a new feature, it should be in its own branch.

Sometimes when a big rewrite needs to happen, we'll just work off one branch because it is more convenient - but as an outside contributor - please try to keep your pull requests to one feature only!
