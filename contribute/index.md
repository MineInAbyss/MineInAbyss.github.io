# Contributing

This section explains how to start coding with us! We look at how to learn Kotlin, find issues, set up and build our plugins, and code style expectations for contributions.

If you wish to contribute with other aspects of the project, such as art, design, or building, check out [mineinabyss.com/contributing](https://mineinabyss.com/contributing).
