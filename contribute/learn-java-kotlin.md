# I want to help but don't know how to code!

This guide will explain how to set up IntelliJ to start learning Java and Kotlin. We will be using the EduTools plugin for IntelliJ, with Jetbrains' introduction to Java guide, as well as the Kotlin Koans to transition from Java to Kotlin.

### Should I learn Java or Kotlin first?

Kotlin is based on Java, and the two can work together, but there are less guides for learning to program from 0 in Kotlin than there are for Java. However, there are many great guides for transitioning from Java to Kotlin, as well as a built-in automatic converter in IntelliJ. Java also has less fancy features and is less overwhelming at first (and makes you appreciate Kotlin's features even more when you get to them :p).

### Setting up

- Install [IntelliJ Community Edition](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=windows) (this is what you code in).
- [Set up your JDK](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/sdk.html#set-up-jdk), I recommend downloading the latest version of OpenJDK (currently 16) straight from the menu in IntelliJ.
- [Set up EduTools](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/education/install-edutools-plugin.html).

### Choosing courses from EduTools

- Open the course menu `File > Learn and Teach > Browse Courses`.
- Go on the Stepik tab.
- Select `Java. Introduction` (you might want to go up through the other Java courses later, especially the one on classes).
- Create and log into a Stepik account.
- Start the course!

### For Kotlin

Same as before, go into the `Community Courses` tab, and select and start Kotlin Koans!

### Learning to write Spigot plugins

Once you have a basic understanding of Java, look around for a spigot development guide. There are tons of resources on YouTube, and it's simple enough
that you can look up things as you go. I've started [my own guide](https://www.notion.so/offz/c7458442792d47f6ba423bdd0f6ee325?v=021699de422447e3ac5940ac8ff8e381)
which we'll build as more coding lessons happen. It is currently rather empty.
