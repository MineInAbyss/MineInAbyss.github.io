# Finding an Issue

We keep track of things to do in issues on GitHub. Each project will have an issues page. Issues are labelled by difficulty, and some are specifically labelled as good first issues.

We have many [GitHub projects](https://github.com/orgs/MineInAbyss/projects) that are focused on different types of work. 

Currently, [Systems & Behaviours](https://github.com/orgs/MineInAbyss/projects/7) contains many small bits of code that can be done without too much effort. Be sure to read the Geary guide if you want to help out with that!

## Contribute

Once you've found an issue to work on, here's the general process to help out with that project:

- Comment on the issue saying you wish to take it up. We will assign you to it shortly.
- Fork the project in question and set it up locally.
- Try to make a new branch for each feature you add.
- Open a Pull Request and wait for us to review!
