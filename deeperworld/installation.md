# Downloading

- [Download DeeperWorld](https://github.com/MineInAbyss/DeeperWorld/releases/latest).
- [Download KotlinSpice](https://github.com/MineInAbyss/KotlinSpice/releases/latest) to provide all the dependencies we need.

# Installation

- Place the jar files into your `plugins` folder.
- Start the server. The plugin should fail to load because it isn't configured yet, but a config file will be created. Move onto [Defining Sections](defining-sections).
