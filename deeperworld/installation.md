# Downloading

You may download the latest version as an artifact through our CI on [GitHub](https://github.com/MineInAbyss/DeeperWorld/actions?query=workflow%3A%22Java+CI%22).

We will eventually make proper releases and perhaps a plugin page.

# Installation

Unzip the `package.zip` and place the jar file into your `plugins` folder.

Start the server. The plugin should fail to start because it isn't configured yet. Move onto [Defining Sections](defining-sections).
