# Starting a New Project

We provide a [:simple-github: project template](https://github.com/MineInAbyss/plugin-template), which you can use to start a new project. We will add instructions to the README file to help you get started in the future.

## Licensing

We don't enforce any specific license for Mine in Abyss related projects, but have some general recommendations:

- Use [MIT](https://mit-license.org/) for libraries or less important plugins.
- Use [AGPL](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.html) for plugins you don't want someone to be able to continue developing in a closed source manner. We recommend AGPL over GPL since plugins don't need to be installed by end users, and the GPL doesn't force someone to distribute source code in this case.
- Use a [Creative Commons](https://chooser-beta.creativecommons.org/) license for non-code assets like textures or sounds (ex. we sometimes use the more restrictive NC variant that force non-commercial use.)
