- We use [:simple-github: Keepup](https://github.com/MineInAbyss/Keepup) to automatically download plugins on our servers. Usage instructions are in the README.

- Plugin versions themselves are defined in [MineInAbyss/server-config](https://github.com/MineInAbyss/server-config/blob/develop/servers/plugin-versions.conf).
