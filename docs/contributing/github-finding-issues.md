# What can I work on?

You can find active projects on our [GitHub projects](https://github.com/orgs/MineInAbyss/projects?type=beta) page. The [Coding Club](https://github.com/orgs/MineInAbyss/projects/27) project contains simpler issues you can get started on quickly. 

## Adventure server

Currently, we're focused on building a new server that will need a lot of custom features. We are working on design docs to share with you here.

## Picking an issue

Once you've found an issue you want to work on:

- Comment on the issue saying you wish to take it up. We will assign you shortly
- Fork the project in question and set it up locally
- Start a new branch
- Once finished, open a pull request and wait for us to review it!
