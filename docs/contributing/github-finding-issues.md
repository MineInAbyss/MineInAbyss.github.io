# What can I work on?

!!! info
    We are planning to start a new project team system as outlined below. We'll announce this more officially once we test the system out more.

!!! note
    Historically, we have used [GitHub projects](https://github.com/orgs/MineInAbyss/projects?type=beta) to list issues people can pick up. We want to avoid using them for newcomers, and focus on letting people work in teams.
