# Join a Project

!!! info "Visit our [Projects page](https://mineinabyss.notion.site/ccd8673db5254ce1b5eaa8f23f250262?v=a3f778813db04319945a85299036346c) for ongoing projects and ideas"

We chat about ongoing projects in the `#coding-projects` forum on Discord. If something seems interesting, feel free to chime in.

Some bigger projects are listed in the projects page linked above. The `needs help` section is especially useful to find projects looking for new members to start.

!!! note
    Historically, we have used [GitHub projects](https://github.com/orgs/MineInAbyss/projects?type=beta) to list issues people can pick up. We want to avoid using them for newcomers, and focus on letting people work in teams.
