# Learning Java & Kotlin

We use Kotlin to make our plugins. Kotlin is built on the same thing as Java so we often interact with Java as well. This guide will help you start learning Kotlin or programming in general.

## No programming knowledge

JetBrains (the creators of Kotlin) have a free [Kotlin Basics](https://hyperskill.org/tracks/18) track on their learning platform Hyperskill.

They split everything into small modules starting from 0 and building up to a project of your choice. Have a look around and start whatever looks interesting. You can even switch midway through!

Note that we use IntelliJ as our IDE. Hyperskill will suggest you use it too, so do, it's great!

## Existing programming experience

Hyperskill can be pretty slow if you are already experienced, so I recommend reading the [Kotlin docs](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/getting-started.html#learn-kotlin-fundamentals). They are extensive and link to many other learning materials.

If you like learning by doing, read the [Basic syntax](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/basic-syntax.html) page and [find an issue](github-finding-issues.md) to work on, while looking up everything you don't understand.

## Notes on IDE
- Use [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=windows).
- [Set up your JDK](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/sdk.html#set-up-jdk) to use the latest OpenJDK version.
