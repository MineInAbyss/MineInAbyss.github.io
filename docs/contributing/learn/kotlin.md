# Learn Kotlin

We use [:simple-kotlin: Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) to make our plugins. Kotlin is built on the same thing as Java, so we often interact with Java as well. This guide will help you start learning Kotlin or programming in general.

## No programming knowledge

!!! info "Recommended: [Kotlin Basics](https://hyperskill.org/tracks/18) track"

JetBrains (the creators of Kotlin) created a free track on their learning platform for Kotlin.

It splits everything into small modules starting from 0 and building up to a project of your choice. Have a look around and start whatever looks interesting. You can even switch midway through!

!!! note
    We use [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download) as our IDE. Hyperskill will suggest you use it too.

## Existing programming experience

!!! info "Recommended: [Kotlin Learning Materials](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/learning-materials-overview.html)"

Hyperskill can be pretty slow if you are already experienced. The Kotlin Docs have a page on learning materials.

I recommend reading over the [Basic Syntax](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/basic-syntax.html) page, then learning by doing with [Kotlin Koans](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/koans.html). You may look at other learning materials if those do not suit you.
