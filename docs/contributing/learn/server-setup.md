# Server setup

You will need a working [PaperMC](https://papermc.io) server if you wish to test plugins locally.

Get the [Paper jar](https://papermc.io/downloads), then install Paper with [this guide](https://paper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/server/getting-started.html). Most of our plugins have setup guides you can follow to continue.


!!! note
    We are working on a Docker image for local development which will help you get set up way faster.
