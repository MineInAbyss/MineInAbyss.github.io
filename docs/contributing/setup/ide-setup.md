# IDE Setup

!!! note "Recommended IDE: [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download)"
    It has solid Kotlin support and we will only be able to help you resolve IDE problems in IntelliJ.

Once installed, [Set up your JDK](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/sdk.html#set-up-jdk) to use the latest OpenJDK version.

## Multiple projects

When working on multiple projects at once, use our [composite master project](https://github.com/MineInAbyss/composite-master). Note it slows down build times, so you may wish to limit yourself to one at a time.
