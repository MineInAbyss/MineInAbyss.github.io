# Starting a New Project

We provide a [project template](https://github.com/MineInAbyss/plugin-template) repo on GitHub, which you can use to start a new project. We will add instructions to the README file to help you get started in the future.

## Licensing

!!! note
    This is a deep rabbit hole that I highly recommend you explore yourself when you get the time. If you're ever interested, consider reading through popular licenses like the GPL to get a more direct understanding of them.

If you wish to host your project on the Mine in Abyss GitHub organization, we recommend licensing your work under an [MIT license](https://mit-license.org/) by adding a `LICENSE` file to your project. We choose this license because it makes it extremely easy for others to use and expand upon your code. You may use a stricter open source license if you can justify it.
