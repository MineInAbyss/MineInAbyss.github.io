# DeeperWorld

Welcome to the DeeperWorld wiki! These pages will explain how to set up and configure DeeperWorld for your own server.

## Notes before using

While this plugin is currently being used on the Mine in Abyss server, we don't currently have any features for migrating configs. Please test things before updating! That being said, we've been using this plugin for about 3 years now, with little breaking changes. It's almost in a state we're happy with, with most issues relating to [section overlap sync](https://github.com/MineInAbyss/DeeperWorld#notable-features-that-dont-get-synced-on-overlaps). Contributions are welcome!

## Getting started

Start by reading the [Installation](installation) guide, from there move onto the pages on the sidebar explaining configuration options. Please note we are only planning to support the latest version of Minecraft with every update.
