# Developer docs

Welcome to our developer wiki. This section contains information about development practices, useful links, and solutions to certain problems.

We keep some internal documentation in Notion, this is primarily for information relating to server infrastructure. Anything that might help a developer to contribute without needing extra permissions should be held here.
