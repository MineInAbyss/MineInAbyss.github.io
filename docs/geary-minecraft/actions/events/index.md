# Events

Events are triggers for your skills. The serialized tag follows the usual component format, with namespaces optionally imported. These generally bridge Bukkit events and may hold extra info, explore them in the sidebar.

!!! note
    Specifying multiple events at once is not yet supported, but a global skill entity may be defined and called.
