We originally built Geary to create custom mobs, items, and blocks in Minecraft. Now these features are separated into their own projects, you can choose only what you need.

## Configs

The only currently supported platform is PaperMC via [geary-papermc](https://github.com/MineInAbyss/geary-papermc). This adds tracking to mobs and items in player inventories. Additional config options are available in [mobzy](https://github.com/MineInAbyss/Mobzy), [looty](https://github.com/MineInAbyss/Looty), and [blocky](https://github.com/MineInAbyss/Blocky), this section documents available options in all these configs.
