Idofront is a set of modules we share between plugins. It includes helpful Minecraft extensions, gradle conventions, and more.

It is meant to be included in your plugins using the [Gradle Shadow Plugin](https://imperceptiblethoughts.com/shadow/). Apply the plugin and install the libraries you want by adding them as `implementation`s. You may include only what you want to use, we split everything into separate modules!
