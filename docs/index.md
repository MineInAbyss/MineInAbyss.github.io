## FAQ

!!! question "Can I use your code in my projects?"
    We try to keep everything we make open source, mostly under the very permissive MIT license which allows you to use and extend upon our plugins without asking. Be sure to read a project's license for specific details.
    <br><br>
    You can find everything on our [:simple-github: GitHub organization](https://github.com/MineInAbyss).

!!! question "What's the best way to reach out if I have questions?"
    You can reach us in [:simple-discord: `#plugin-dev`](https://discord.gg/4rJTVu4EuQ) on Discord. You may need to give yourself the coding club role to view the channel.
